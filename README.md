## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- What are the supported media file types?

  - Video: .mov, .mp4, .webm
  - Image: .ico, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .webp

- Is there going to be support for Windows?

  - I would love to release this on Windows, but I just do not have access to windows computer right now. I will add it to the road-map when I get one.

- How do I get the latest version of Orbital?

  - For the time being, I will update the downloadable DMG file on Gumroad whenever a new version comes out. You should be able to download it and follow the installation guide. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/SuboptimalEng) to get the news about any recent updates.

- Why can't Orbital automatically update like other desktop apps (Spotify, Notion, Discord, etc)?

  - This requires me to set up an LLC and get an Apple developer license. This is a viable option for companies that have lots of resources, but since I'm a solo-developer (making less than $100 a month), setting this up will cost time and money which I'd rather spend on adding new features.

- What is your refund policy?

  - I can give a full refund if you don't like your purchase (within 14 days). Just send me a message on Twitter [@SuboptimalEng](https://twitter.com/SuboptimalEng).

- Want to get in touch?

  - For personal inquiries, send me a message on Twitter [@SuboptimalEng](https://www.twitter.com/SuboptimalEng).
  - For business inquiries, send me an email at suboptimaleng at gmail dot com.
