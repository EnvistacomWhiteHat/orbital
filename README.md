First of all, thank you. Seriously, thanks a bunch! I recently quit my job to become an indie hacker and I really appreciate your support.

## General

## Mac Installation Guide

- First download the DMG file.
- Open it and you will see this popup.
- Whoa Suboptimal, that looks scary, why is it there?

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Is there going to be support for Windows?

  - I would love to release this on Windows, but I just do not have access to windows computer right now. I will add it to the road-map when I get one.

- How do I get the latest version of Orbital?

  - For the time being, I will update the downloadable DMG file on Gumroad whenever a new version comes out. You should be able to download it and follow the installation guide. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/SuboptimalEng) to get the news about any recent updates.

- Why can't Orbital automatically update like other desktop apps (Spotify, Notion, Discord, etc)?

  - This requires me to set up an LLC and get an Apple developer license. This is a viable option for companies that have lots of resources, but since I'm a solo-developer (making less than $100 a month), setting this up will cost time and money which I'd rather spend that on adding new features.
