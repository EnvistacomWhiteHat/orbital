# ðŸ›° Orbital - Video File Browser

Orbital is a local-first desktop app that allows you to search, filter, and preview video (and image) files on your computer. It turns your computer's file browser into YouTube.

Orbital is available for ðŸ‘‰ [purchase on Gumroad]() for $10 USD.

## How does it work?

You select a main folder, and Orbital will load the supported media files in that folder (and all sub-folders) and allow you to easily search, filter, and preview them.

## Demo

- Choose root directory
- Scroll down to load all files
- Search for a video file
- Preview a video on hover
- Show video preview display
- Show keybindings in action
- Change color themes

## Features

- #### Gallery view of videos and images.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- What media file types are supported?

  - Video: .mov, .mp4, .webm
  - Image: .ico, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .webp

- Is there going to be support for Windows?

  - I would love to release this on Windows, but I just do not have access to windows computer right now. I will add it to the road-map when I get one.

- How do I get the latest version of Orbital?

  - For the time being, I will update the downloadable DMG file on Gumroad whenever a new version comes out. You should be able to re-download it and follow the installation guide. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/SuboptimalEng) to get the news about any recent updates.

- Why can't Orbital automatically update like other desktop apps (Spotify, Notion, Discord, etc)?

  - This requires me to set up an LLC and get an Apple developer license. This is a viable option for companies that have lots of resources, but since I'm a solo-developer (making less than $100 a month), setting this up will cost time and money which I'd rather spend on adding new features.

- What is your refund policy?

  - I can give a full refund if you don't like your purchase (within 14 days). Just send me a message on Twitter [@SuboptimalEng](https://twitter.com/SuboptimalEng).

- Want to get in touch?
