# ðŸ›° Orbital - Video File Browser

Orbital is a local-first desktop app that allows you to search, filter, and preview video (and image) files on your computer. It turns your computer's file browser into YouTube.

Orbital is available to ðŸ‘‰ [purchase on Gumroad](https://suboptimaleng.gumroad.com/l/orbital-app) for $10 USD. All love (hate, questions, and suggestions) can be directed to me on Twitter ðŸ‘‰ [@SuboptimalEng](https://www.twitter.com/SuboptimalEng).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- What media file types are supported?

  - Video: .mov, .mp4, .webm
  - Image: .ico, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .webp

- Is there going to be support for Windows?

  - I would love to release this on Windows, but I just do not have access to windows computer right now. I will add it to the road-map when I get one.

- How do I get the latest version of Orbital?

  - For the time being, I will update the downloadable DMG file on Gumroad whenever a new version comes out. You should be able to re-download it and follow the installation guide. You can follow me on Twitter to get the news about any recent updates.

- Why can't Orbital automatically update like other desktop apps (Spotify, Notion, Discord, etc)?

  - This requires me to set up an LLC and get an Apple developer license. This is a viable option for companies that have lots of resources, but since I'm a solo-developer (making less than $100 a month), setting this up will cost time and money which I'd rather spend on adding new features.

- What is your refund policy?

  - I can give you a full refund if you don't like your purchase (within 14 days). Just send me a message on Twitter.

- Want to get in touch?

  - For personal inquiries, send me a message on Twitter ðŸ‘‰ [@SuboptimalEng](https://www.twitter.com/SuboptimalEng).
  - For business inquiries, send me an email at suboptimaleng at gmail dot com.
